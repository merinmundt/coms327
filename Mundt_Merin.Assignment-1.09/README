--I started by creating a vector and a map. My vector labeled carrySlots,
 and my map labeled equiptmentSlots. I use these throughout the project to 
 hold what the PC is wearing and what he has in is pouch.
--I detect which objects I am picking up and what type of weapon they are. 
Once I pick on up, I am able to see what I have in my pouch and what type 
of equiptment I have on. Once I am wearing one type of weapon, it is removed 
from my inventory. If I try to wear an certain type while I am already wearing
another object of that type, the object are replaced.
--When a monster is in the cell that I would like to enter, and I try to move
into that cell, I attack him. Our damage is collected and if either of us fall
below 0, we die. 
--My hitpoints, equiptment, and inventory carry over between levels. 
--After checking each of the letter cases, my dungeon is reprinted. 
    --Before reprinting, and completing the case, I prompt for carry slot or
    prompt for equiptment slot. 
--If spongebob dies, the game is over
