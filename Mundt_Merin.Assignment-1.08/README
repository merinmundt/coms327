--created 2 new files Input.cpp & Input.h
--Used vectors to list all of the descriptors of the monsters
--Input.cpp first attempts to open the file. Then checks to see if the first line of the file is valid. And if so, it then uses the get line function to read the next line of the file. Then will only read up to the the first space to check what the first word is. Checks the first word, makes sure that that word has not been read before, and then sets the following rest of the line to my npc_template_t. 
--once the file is finished, the template is pushed back and returned.
