Added two arrays that hold the events and that hold the monsters. Run game event method uses the game event array, initiates the heap, gets the PC event, and then adds the monsters events.

Game is started with player character being created and monsters being added at a random number. Monsters are created each with a different type of unique skill. And each gets a random speed. 

If the monstercount is down to 0 and the player character is still alive then the player wins. If the player character is still in there then the monsters, depeneding on their skill move towards the player character at an event rate according to their speed. Turns are not fair. Could be monsters turn more than once before the player characters turn.

once the monsters catch the player character the character is killed and the game is over.
